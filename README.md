## Howto guide - the simple way

Level 0 users === i am new here, trying things out:

- url:
- use + to add a name, if you have > 2 names than you can start brewing...

Level 1 users === i am excited and want to be more efficient:

- url:
- use + to add comma separted names to speed up the game. again if you have > 2 names you can start brewing...

Level 2 users === i know tech, let me query this:

- url: query-param list
- you could create bookmarks with urls to re-use it whenever needed

Level 3 users === i really know tech, let me own this:

- url: query-param list, query-param name
- now you're the chief with predefined lists

happy pairing!
