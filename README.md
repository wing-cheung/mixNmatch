Checkout the brilliant howto guide!!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Howto guide - the simple way

Level 0 users: "i am new here, trying things out"

- url: "https://wing-cheung.github.io/mixNmatch/"
- use + to add a name, if you have > 2 names than you can start brewing...

Level 1 users: "i am excited and want to be more efficient"

- url: "https://wing-cheung.github.io/mixNmatch/"
- use + to add comma separted names to speed up the game. again if you have > 2 names you can start brewing...

Level 2 users: "i know tech, let me query this"

- url: "https://wing-cheung.github.io/mixNmatch/?list=Alpha,Bravo,Charlie"
- you could create bookmarks with urls to re-use it whenever needed

Level 3 users: "i really know tech, let me own this"

- url: "https://wing-cheung.github.io/mixNmatch/?list=Alpha,Bravo,Charlie&name=nato"
- now you're the chief with predefined lists

if sth goes wrong, don't worry, clear localStorage and refreshPage to start again ^^

happy pairing!
